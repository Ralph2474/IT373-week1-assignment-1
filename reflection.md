When I started with the assignment, I was still a bit confused about how it worked. To guide myself, 
I followed Sir Jessie Paragasâ€™ screen recording. Before beginning the assignment, I familiarized myself with the basic commands to use and how to install Python and Django. 
I also created a draft project first before working on the actual assignment. This helped me understand the process better and gave me a safe space to practice.  
I made sure to practice the commands for creating a virtual environment and installing Django until I became more confident with them. 
At first, it was overwhelming because there were many steps to remember, but repetition helped me recall the process. 
Whenever I got confused or lost, I went back to the screen recording to double-check the instructions and see where I needed to continue.
Through this process, I learned the importance of patience and reviewing instructions carefully. 
The challenges I faced pushed me to pay attention to details, and eventually, 
I was able to complete the setup successfully. This experience also gave me more confidence to explore Django further in the future.
